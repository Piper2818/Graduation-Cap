# Graduation-Cap
This is a code that I wrote for fun to upload into my microbit. My microbit was attached to my graduation cap along with a small battery cap and it displayed the scrolling text 
"Hello Real World" followed by a short animation of a heart throughout my grauation ceremony. I wrote it in both Python and java but I ended up running the pythong code since there 
was no real difference between the two.
